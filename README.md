# MiniTutorialCPP
This project is intended to describe general programming concepts in C++, along with concrete, functioning code examples.

## The structure of the project and some ideas
1. Basic concepts of OOP/GP/etc illustrated in a common markdown file: basic_concepts_of_oop.md .
2. C++ header files in the folder {project_root}/include/
3. C++ implementation files in the folder {project_root}/src/
4. When a new concept is declared in the file mentioned in the first step, the corresponding code should also be added immediately. 
5. The concept description and the code should be linked somehow.
